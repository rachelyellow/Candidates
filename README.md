## Additional Information - Assessment Questions

###### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

React and plain JavaScript are the main requirements for this project. As I created my wire frames I decided that this scenario would work best as a single-page application. I did not use redux because I did not see the need for it in this app at its current state. I also did not see the need for other frameworks/libraries, as in my opinion React is powerful enough to get the job done. In the future, if I was to further build on this project I would consider using Redux for state management.

###### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- I could add timestamps to the comments
- Could improve on the style with more details
- Improvements on accessibility
- Add feature to select multiple candidates for comparison


###### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
- If there were many more candidates in the database, I would improve the user experience by limiting the "Candidates" sidebar to 10 candidates and a time, and add controls to search and navigate through the people.
- If there are mulitple hiring managers using this software I could add in a voting or bookmarking/favourites system to help make the selection process easier.
